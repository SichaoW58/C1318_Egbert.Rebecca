This quarto file is meant to set up the essential folders and copy the template to start the project.

This is the 3rd step of the workflow:

3rd step: create folders/subfolders

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| include: false

## file folder setup
library(fs)   # creat folder dir_create()
library(here) # easy to do cross reference in the project.

```

```{r}
#| label: setup-folder
#| include: false

# create the default folder/subfolder, If folders already exist, it won't run.

dir_create(here("Data"))  # store raw data, clean data. 
dir_create(here("Data/Raw"))  
dir_create(here("Data/Clean")) 

dir_create(here("Documents"))  # all the docs
dir_create(here("Code"))       # r code
dir_create(here("Outputs"))    #outputs
dir_create(here("E-mails"))    # correspondence

file_copy("C:/Users/wangsic1/OneDrive - Michigan State University/CSTAT main/Template/Quarto template_THAA_6_30_2023.qmd", here("Code/analysis_test.qmd"), overwrite = FALSE)

# The first argument is the existing setup file:
"C:/Users/wangsic1/OneDrive - Michigan State University/CSTAT main/Template/Quarto template_THAA_6_30_2023.qmd"

# The second argument is the new folder it put in and give a proper new for the analysis file:

#here("Code/analysis_test.qmd")



# dir_ls()    # briefly check
# dir_tree()  # Show the tree, not necessary, takes time.
# dir_tree("Data")

```

Now, we complete the setup of a new project.

You may want to delete the extra files, which I am not able to exclude currently. (looking for some solution).
